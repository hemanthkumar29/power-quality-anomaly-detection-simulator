## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### Realistic Dataset Features

The realistic dataset simulates real-world power quality measurements:

```python
# Realistic voltage with measurement noise
rms_voltage = 230.0 + np.random.normal(0, 2.0)  # ±2V noise

# THD based on typical measurements
thd = 0.03 + np.random.normal(0, 0.01)  # 3% ± 1%

# Power factor variations
power_factor = np.random.uniform(0.85, 0.98)

# Flicker effects
flicker = np.random.uniform(0, 0.5) if event in ['Sag', 'Swell'] else 0
```

### IEEE 1159 Compliance

| Event | Voltage Range | Duration | THD | Compliance |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----|------------|
| Normal | 0.95-1.05 pu | Continuous | <5% | ✅ IEEE 1159 |
| Sag | 0.1-0.9 pu | 0.5 cyc - 1 min | Variable | ✅ IEEE 1159 |
| Swell | 1.1-1.8 pu | 0.5 cyc - 1 min | Variable | ✅ IEEE 1159 |
| Harmonic | 0.9-1.1 pu | Continuous | 5-20% | ✅ IEEE 519 |
| Outage | <0.1 pu | >1 cyc | N/A | ✅ IEEE 1159 |
